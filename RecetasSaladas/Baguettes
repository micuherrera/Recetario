Ingredients:
1. 1Kg high protein flour (at least 10% protein by weight).
2. 1 spoonful of salt.
3. 1 yeast packet (if the flour does not come with it).

Mix the salt and the yeast with the dry flour and mix well in a large bowl. 
Add water carefully in the amount needed until its well hydrated. Let it rest 5 minuts with cover.
Fold the dough onto itself severaltimes to incorporate fully. Wet your hands to avoid sticking to the dough.
Knead the dough without ripping it and place it back on the bowl. Cover it.
Rest 45 minutes (rest #1).
Drop the dough onto the board and fold it into iselft several times.
Rest 45 minutes (rest #2).
Repeat.
After rest #4, flour you table and divide the dough into 5-6 for each loaf.
Flour each dough and knead it into shape by spreading the dough thin with your fingers. Then roll up one border to form a long and thin shape. Use the heel of the hand to merge the borders.
Let it rest with a film lightly covered in oil (to avoid sticking).
Put the strips of dough into a floured cloth and make wrinkles with the cloth to shape the dough, like this https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/713Zc1iZbxL._AC_SL1000_.jpg
